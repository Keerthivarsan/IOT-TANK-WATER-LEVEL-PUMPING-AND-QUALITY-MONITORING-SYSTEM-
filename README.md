Short Description :

The Water Level, Pumping, and Quality Monitoring System automates water management by monitoring water levels and quality using sensors. It controls a pump based on water levels and displays real-time data, including pH value, on an LCD screen.

Components Required:

• Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)

• pH sensor

• Pump motor

• Relay module

• Microcontroller (eg. Arduino Uno)

• LCD display (16x2 with I2C module)

• Power supply

• Wiring and enclosure

How It Works :

Water Level Monitoring: The ultrasonic sensor measures the water level and sends data to the microcontroller.

Pump Control: The microcontroller activates or deactivates the pump based on preset water level thresholds.

Quality Monitoring: The pH sensor measures water quality, determining whether the water is acidic, neutral, or alkaline.

Data Display: The LCD screen displays water level percentage, pH value, and pump status in real-time.
